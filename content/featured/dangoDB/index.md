dangoDB is a light-weight MongoDB Object Document Mapper (ODM) library built for the Deno runtime. It provides the core functionality and familiar look and feel of established Node-based libraries. With dangoDB, developers can construct schemas and models, and they can enforce strict type-casting and schema validation to structure their databases. The query functions available from the deno_mongo driver can all be accessed with ease. Additionally, [dangoDB.land](https://dangoDB.land/) features a web-based GUI that auto-generates schema for users to copy &amp; paste directly into their code.
